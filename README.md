I made a Rock Paper Scissors game that you can play vs the computer. This my first project working with javascript,

I faced a lot of problems while making this game like directing to a new html file using Js, not being able

to reach a local file in firefox mozilla because of security precautions etc.

I tried to make this game visually appealing, so I made all the visuals and graphics by myself,

and I tried to make a simple storyline to give it more meaning and purpose. 

#Story:
"the computer rebelled and you have to fight it playing Rock Ppaer Scissors, you have to win 5 times, if you win you will gain control again,
if you lose the computer took over everything."
