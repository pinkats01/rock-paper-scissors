# Description:
I made a Rock Paper Scissors game that you can play vs the computer. This my first project working with javascript,
I faced a lot of problems while making this game like directing to a new html file using Js, not being able
to reach a local file in firefox mozilla because of security precautions etc, but after facing a lot of problems I feel like I'm 
more comfortable in facing and expecting them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I tried to make this game visually appealing, so I made all the visuals and graphics by myself,
and I tried to make a simple storyline to give it more meaning and purpose.
If you lose or win, in both instances there is a visual, I spent a lot of time making them so I wanted to people to notice them.

# Story:
"the computer rebelled and you have to fight it playing Rock Ppaer Scissors, you have to win 5 times, if you win you will gain control again,
if you lose the computer took over everything."
