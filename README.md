# Description:
I made a Rock Paper Scissors game that you can play vs the computer. This is my first project working with javascript,</br>
I faced a lot of problems while making this game like directing to a new html file using Js, not being able</br>
to reach a local file in firefox mozilla because of security precautions, not being able to autoplay audio when a page loads</br>
because of permission and security issues that's why I made the background music start when a click event has been triggered.</br> 
But after facing a couple of problems I feel like I'm more comfortable in facing and expecting them.</br>
I tried to make this game visually appealing, so I spent a lot of time making the visuals and graphics by myself,</br>
If you lose or win, in both instances there is a visual, I spent a lot of time making them so I wanted people to notice them.</br>
and I tried to add a simple storyline to give it more meaning and purpose.</br>

# Story:
"the computer rebelled and you have to fight it playing Rock Paper Scissors, you have to win 5 times, if you win you will gain control again,</br>
if you lose the computer took over everything."
